# Fablab ontology

At Fablab amersfoort we believe in grassroots movements which encourage community members to contribute by taking responsibility and action for their community [1]. Digitalization helps to bring communities together [2] but should based on common digital values. 

This ontology [3] helps to relate those values by underlaying architectural principles (rules) which helps making changes within a starfish organization [4].
The ontology is based 4 main concepts:

- [values](https://triplydb.com/ColinMeerveld/-/queries/Query-5/1) (Our digital values)
- [Principles](https://triplydb.com/ColinMeerveld/-/queries/Query/1) (what are the architectural rules or guidelines to enable those values)
- [Outcomes](https://triplydb.com/ColinMeerveld/-/queries/Query-6/1) (The outcome when we apply the principles)
- [Applications](https://triplydb.com/ColinMeerveld/-/queries/Query-7/1) (Praktical applications for individuals, inspired by [skilltree](https://github.com/sjpiper145/makerskilltree))

The knowledge base could be found on [triplydb](https://triplydb.com/ColinMeerveld/fablab/)
You could use [Yasgui](https://docs.triply.cc/yasgui/) to make some interactive applications. 
Some examples are provides in the query section.
