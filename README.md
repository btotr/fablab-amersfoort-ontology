# Fablab
What are digital public values and why do we care about them. An ontology is a formal representation of knowledge within a specific domain, describing the concepts, properties, and relationships between entities. It serves as a structured framework for organizing and understanding information.

Within Fablab amersfoort we have a strong belief in public digital values like privacy and independency. However it is sometimes hard to make sense out of it. Like how does open source software contribute to those values or why should we use masterdon for social networking. This ontology helps structuring those questions by 4 main concepts:

- values (The public values itself)
- Principles (what are the architectural rules or guidelines to enable those values)
- Outcomes (The outcome when we apply the principles)
- Applications (Concrete examples for individuals to be aligned with the values)
