# Fablab Amersfoort Ontology

At Fablab Amersfoort we have a small-scale workshop offering digital fabrication to make almost anything[^1]. We believe in grassroots movements which encourage community members to contribute by taking responsibility and action for their community [^2]. Digitalization helps to bring communities together [^3] but should based on some common digital values. 

This ontology [^4] relate those values by underlaying architectural principles (rules) which helps making changes within a starfish organization [^5].
The ontology is based on 4 main concepts:

- [Values](https://api.triplydb.com/queries/ColinMeerveld/Query/3/run?class=Value) (Our digital values)
- [Principles](https://api.triplydb.com/queries/ColinMeerveld/Query/3/run?class=Principle) (what are the architectural rules or guidelines to enable those values)
- [Outcomes](https://api.triplydb.com/queries/ColinMeerveld/Query/3/run?class=Outcome) (The outcome when we apply the principles)
- [Applications](https://api.triplydb.com/queries/ColinMeerveld/Query/3/run?class=Application) (Practical applications for individuals, inspired by [skilltree](https://github.com/sjpiper145/makerskilltree))

The knowledge base could be found on [triplydb](https://triplydb.com/ColinMeerveld/fablab/).
You could use [Yasgui](https://docs.triply.cc/yasgui/) to make some interactive applications.
Some examples are provides in the [query section](https://triplydb.com/ColinMeerveld/-/queries).\
